**Character**

1. playing character- player(played by the user through controls)
2. non playing character- obstacle(programmed in the computer to create hinderance for the player)

**Goals**

1.The player should achieve the objective of the game and score more and win the game

eg :pacman has a goal of eating all the food in the game without being hit by the obstacles(ghost)

**Rules**

1.The pacman should bot get hit by the obstacle (ghost)

2.It should eat the power boosters so that the ghosts would low down and the player eat them

3.the pacman should finish all the food in the game to win.

4.We should finish all the food before all the lives are gone

**Balance**

1.we should always have a balance in the game so that it is not to difficult or not so easy to win

eg: The balance in the pacman game is that ghost patrols the the player(pacman)When the pacman eats the power Booster the ghost slows down and the player gets a chance to eat the ghost and get more points and disable them for a few seconds

**Adaptivity**

1.Adaptivity is to approach difficulties or challenges when we progress in the game.

eg. The ghost changes its speed according to the game and slows down when the player eats the power booster .We have less chances of scoring after we eat most of the food because there will be less food and the ghost will be behind us and there are more chances of getting eaten by the ghost.

**Skills And Chances**

1.We should use the power Boosters wisely and try to kill the ghost every time we eat a power booster .

2.We should try to eat all the food in one side first and then go to the other side to win.

3.When we eat the power boosters we get to disable the ghost for a few seconds and also get to eat the ghosts and score more points.

4.We have openings on the either side of the maze so that we can directly change sides without crossing the whole maze.

**Feedback**

1.The sound effects for different movements and behavior.

2.The score.

3.The lives(chances).
